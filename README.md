# ESP8266-BUG-I2S-MIC

## Very simple bug with ESP8266 and I2S MEMS microphone for listening and recording Audio via UDP.


The main.cpp file in the src folder was written for PlatformIO, but it is possible to convert it for Arduino IDE.

You just need to change the file extension from cpp to ino and delete "#include <Arduino.h>".

The project is very simple and requires only a few connections.

#### Below you can find the connection diagram for NodeMCU.
